# Flutter-Notes
My grandfather was using the Xiaomi Notes app, but one day all of his notes were suddenly deleted. When I checked his Mi Cloud account, there were no notes in the trash or backup section — everything was gone. Because of that experience, I developed a new note-taking app where nothing gets accidentally deleted.
